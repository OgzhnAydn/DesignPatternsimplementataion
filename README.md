When building an application or system, design patterns are the best, established approaches a programmer can apply to handle common challenges.

Design patterns can help to accelerate the development process by offering tried-and-true development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns aids in the prevention of small faults that can lead to large difficulties, as well as improving code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.
